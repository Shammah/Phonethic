As we will be doing quite some hackerman command line work, we are required to install a *terminal emulator* on your phone. I highly recommend **Termux**, as it offers some packages we will need later on, as well as a way to prevent the phone from treating the validator as a background process after a while, making it unusable in the long term. Termux can be easily found on the Google Play Store. Once installed, you can immediately open Termux.
